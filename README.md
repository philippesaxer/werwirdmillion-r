# PHP Development Environment

- [**MailDev**](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) SMTP Server + Web Interface for viewing and testing emails during development.
- **PHP 8.4.x (CLI)** with Composer, PHP CodeSniffer, phpDocumentor, phpunit and XDebug for development.

## Installation

- Clone or download and extract this repo
- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and check the contained settings
- Open the project main folder (the folder containing this README) with vscode
- Build the docker container with `docker-compose build` and start it with `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal or use the context menu over the `docker-compose.yml` file (right click > compose up) from vscode
- Keep an eye at bottom right and confirm when you are asked to reopen the project in the dev container

## Remote development

The Visual Studio Code [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder or repository inside a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set. The [devcontainer.json](./.devcontainer.json) file tells VS Code how to access (or create) the development container with well-defined tool and runtime stack.

**Since everything that has to do with the stack, only runs in the container, you have to put the commands into the corresponding container.** Check the provided wrappers in the folder `./bin/`.

**The local folder `code` is mapped to `/opt/code` in the phpdev container**

## Installed utilities

- ~~[PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) is a set of two PHP scripts; the main `phpcs` script that tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard, and a second `phpcbf` script to automatically correct coding standard violations.~~ **No longer maintained.**
- [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org/) is the de-facto documentation application for PHP projects.
- [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP.
- [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) - Debugger and Profiler Tool for PHP

### Coding standard

The configured coding standard used by PHP_CodeSniffer is the [PSR-12 coding standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). To check a file against the PEAR coding standard, use the `--standard` command line argument: `phpcs --standard=PEAR /path/to/code-directory`

### XDebug trigger

The name of the trigger is XDEBUG_TRIGGER, and Xdebug checks for its presence in either $\_ENV (environment variable), $\_GET or $\_POST variable, or $\_COOKIE (HTTP cookie name).

**Copy the `bin` folder to your local computer and add the local folder to your PATH environment variable.**

If you are using powershell add following command into your vscode settings.json:

```json
    "phpcs.executablePath": "phpcs.bat",
    "php.executablePath": "php.bat",
    "php.validate.executablePath": "php.bat"
```

If you are using git bash add following command into your vscode settings.json:

```json
    "phpcs.executablePath": "phpcs",
    "php.executablePath": "php",
